    "# Evaluating Bulk Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Some variables, such as relative fractions and wet depositions, are often fractions of other variables. The example we will be looking at here is the (nonsense) fraction of PM10 to O3: $PM10/O3$. Now imagine that we have daily observations, but want to look at the fractions on a monthly timescale. There are two ways of doing this, first is to read the daily observations, calculate the fraction then take the monthly mean of the fraction. This is way PyAerocom normally does all derived variables. But, there is a second way: First you do the monthly mean for the numerator and the denominator in the fraction separately, then take the fraction of the monthly means. This is different from the first method since $E[X/Y] \\neq E[X]/E[Y]$. Variables where we want to use the latter method is called **Bulk Variables**"
